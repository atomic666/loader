# instructions:

>> replace payload='payload_here' with your payload

>> run zmap/form a list of bruteforced IoT, etc

>> use the script & load to given payload

>> example: 'python viridium.py iot.txt'

---------------------------------------------------
>> educational purposes only, loading to botnets by any other means & hosting one for malicious use, is indeed illegal :

The installation of malware on the victim’s computer, without the victim’s consent, to build the botnet is illegal and the activity the botnet conducts may be illegal.

>> the same could be said about maliciously bruteforcing devices & servers to load rootkits, or enslave them
